# Learn Next.js - App Router Best Practices

Welcome to the **Learn Next.js** project! This repository is your playground to explore and master Next.js app routing best practices. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this project is designed to make learning Next.js both fun and practical.

## About This Project

This project is part of the Next.js App Router Course, aimed at teaching you how to build scalable and maintainable applications using Next.js. It includes a dashboard application that demonstrates:

- **App Routing**: Learn how to structure your app with the new App Router.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Handle dynamic paths like a pro.
- **Data Fetching**: Fetch and manage data efficiently.
- **UI Components**: Build reusable and accessible UI components.
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive designs.
